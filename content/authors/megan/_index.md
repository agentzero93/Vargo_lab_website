## **Biography**

During my time at Duke University, I examined the influence of genetics on migration and habitat preference in blue crabs, *Callinectes sapidus*. At various life stages, crab migrations are influenced by environmental cues, including light, salinity, chemistry, depth change, turbulence, and water flow. Though adult and juvenile blue crabs live in estuaries, the larval stages of all genotypes are mixed and develop in the coastal ocean, with migration patterns inland can varying greatly. My analysis revealed significant genetic differentiation between crabs that migrated to contrasting salinities. I am looking forward to assisting with genetic and biological research on arthropod pests of the urban environment.
