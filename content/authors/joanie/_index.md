## **Biography**

I completed my M.Sc. in the Entomology Department at the University of Georgia. I researched the genetics involved in the basis of colony social structure in the red imported fire ant (*Solenopsis invicta*). In addition, I also taught a variety of biology and entomology courses, participated in outreach, and became more focused on science communication. Currently, I research the molecular basis of behavioral and physiological manipulation of red imported fire ants (*S. invicta*) by phorid fly parasitoids (*Pseudacteon* sp., decapitating flies), aid in differential gene expression analysis of *Nylanderia fulva* (tawny crazy ants) and am active in science communication.
