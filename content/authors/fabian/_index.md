## **Biography**
I knew that my future would be in a biological field from early chidlhood on and I kept pursuing that idea until today and future to come. Born and raised in Germany, I recieved my Bsc in Biology at the Heinrich-Heine University in D√ºsseldorf investigating behavioral ecology of (ovo)viviparous cockroaches, followed by a Masters degree from the University of Hamburg conducting fascinating research on the parallel evolution in molecular toxin resistance of mammals and insects. Since Fall 2017, I've been a member of the Vargo lab, investigating possible control of the invasive tawny crazy ant by using RNA interference. My current plan is to finish my program and graduate by Fall 2021. I'm proud to be a first generation academic in my familiy and not only get one, but that I'm working on my third college degree. Due to my background, I highly value the impact of science communication and outreach. I've spend a lot of my free time since my undergrad time doing outreach, talking about insects and biology to children, students and adults alike. When I'm not in the lab or doing outreach, I'm an avid homebrewer, student of Texas BBQ and creating insect crafts and proud owner of a sizable collection of pet cockroaches.
