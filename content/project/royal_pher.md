Termite colonies may contain thousands of individuals. Their ecological success depends on the efficient allocation of these individuals to different colony tasks, like foraging for food, rearing brood or into reproductive task. This partition is usually mediated through royal pheromones produced by the queen and king, preventing additional individuals to reproduce within colonies. In some species, workers can take over the reproduction when the primary king or queen dies. They become secondary reproductives and their presence inhibits additional worker development into secondary reproductives. [Heneicosane](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3888) was recently described as a royal pheromone produced by secondary reproductives of *Reticulitermes flavipes*. We found that this pheromone was not used by the primary reproductives of this species, suggesting that secondary reproductives evolved a distinct ‘royal’ chemical blend. We also showed that the chemical difference between secondary reproductives and workers are even higher than the one between primary reproductives and workers, suggesting that secondary reproductives may over-signal their reproductive status.
